Load and clear training data:
```{r}
library(caret)
myData <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", na.strings=c("NA","NULL","#DIV/0!"))

#Choose appropriated columns:
clearData <- myData[,colSums(is.na(myData))==0]

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=clearData$classe,
                              p=0.7, list=FALSE)
training <- clearData[inTrain,]
testingInner <- [-inTrain,]

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
